# Ticket Writing

Distill one source of work — a phase of `PROJECT.md` **or** a feature spec from `.opencode/features/` (produced by the `feature-definition` skill, status `ready`) — into the smallest set of tickets that fully delivers its goal.

You describe **what** each ticket must achieve. The **how** is decided later, per ticket, by the `ticket-planning` step — so keep `## Technical notes` to constraints and pointers, not implementation plans.

## Sources and naming

| | Phase source | Feature source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | Phase number + exact text of `PROJECT.md` | Path to `.opencode/features/<slug>.md` |
| Ticket dir | `.opencode/tickets/phase-<N>/` | `.opencode/tickets/feature-<slug>/` |
| Ticket id prefix | `P<N>` | `F-<slug>` |
| Frontmatter key | `phase: <N>` | `feature: "<slug>"` |
| `source:` field | `"PROJECT.md → Phase <N> → <Task ref>"` | `".opencode/features/<slug>.md"` |

(A third ticket origin exists — `arch:` tickets written directly by the `architecture-review` skill into `.opencode/tickets/arch/`. You never groom those.)

Branch names follow the existing pattern with the lowercase prefix: `feat/p<n>-t<nn>-<slug>` or `feat/f-<slug>-t<nn>-<slug>`.

For feature sources, groom from the spec's `## What needs to be done`, `## Scope`, and `## Definition of done` sections; treat its `## Open questions` defaults as decisions unless the user says otherwise.

## Sizing rules

- **One ticket = one PR.** A single focused change a reviewer can evaluate in minutes.
- **Independently verifiable.** Each ticket has acceptance criteria that can be tested right after it merges, without waiting for later tickets.
- **Vertical slices over horizontal layers.** Prefer "schema + query layer for entity X" over "all schemas, then all queries" when the phase allows it.
- **~100–400 changed lines** is the sweet spot. If a ticket drafts bigger, split it. If two tickets are trivially small and tightly coupled, merge them.
- **Explicit seams.** A ticket that introduces an interface/boundary used by later tickets comes first and defines the contract in its acceptance criteria.

## Dependency analysis

- For every ticket, set `depends_on` to the minimal list of ticket ids that must merge first.
- Tickets with disjoint `depends_on` closures are parallelizable — the orchestrator uses this, so be strict and accurate.
- Order tickets so the phase stays mergeable: each merge leaves `main` working (builds + tests pass).

## Carry-overs

If the orchestrator gave you a previous architecture review: its open findings/carry-over items are mandatory inputs. Either fold each into a ticket's scope/acceptance criteria or explicitly note in your report why it was deferred. (Newer reviews emit their findings directly as `ARCH` tickets — treat those as ordinary dependency inputs instead.)

## Procedure

1. Read the full source text (phase section or feature spec) and its goal.
2. Read the carry-over/findings section of the previous arch review (if provided).
3. List candidate work units; apply the sizing rules; determine dependencies.
4. Write one file per ticket at `<ticket-dir>/<NN>-<short-slug>.md` (`NN` = zero-padded execution order; ticket dir per the source table above).
5. Final message: numbered ticket list (id, title, depends_on) + one sizing rationale line each.

## Ticket template

```markdown
---
id: <PREFIX>-T<NN>
phase: <N>              # phase source — OR —
feature: "<slug>"       # feature source — OR —
arch: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"    # arch-review source (only in tickets written by the arch-reviewer)
title: <imperative title, <= 60 chars>
status: pending
depends_on: []
branch: feat/<prefix-lowercase>-t<nn>-<short-slug>
pr: null
source: "PROJECT.md → Phase <N> → <Task ref>"   # or ".opencode/features/<slug>.md" or ".opencode/reviews/<date>-architecture.md"
---

## Objective

<1–3 sentences: what this delivers and why it matters to the phase/feature goal.>

## Scope

**In scope:**
- <concrete deliverable>

**Out of scope:**
- <explicit exclusion, especially tempting adjacent work>

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] <testable statement — a reviewer can verify each one mechanically>
- [ ] Build passes and relevant tests pass

## Technical notes

<Relevant constraints, file/module pointers, contracts to honor, carry-over items from arch review. Leave empty if none.>

## Plan

<Empty at creation. The ticket-planning step fills this in: approach, files to touch, ordered steps, verification.>

## Review feedback

<Empty at creation. Orchestrator appends PR-review findings here.>
```

## Quality bar for your output

- A stranger could implement each ticket without reading the source text.
- No ticket requires "and then also" — that is two tickets.
- Acceptance criteria are observable behavior, not aspirations ("endpoint returns X for Y", not "works well").
